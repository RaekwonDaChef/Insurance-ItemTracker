# Insurance-ItemTracker

This is a web app that I had created for personal use, to deal with a fire insurance claim related to an unfortunate fire at my residence. Was used to manage the non-restorable list of contents from within the residence, and the collection of money (replacement cost), to handle receipt submissions to the insurance company.

##### Front End:
     HTML5, SCSS (CSS3), JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap 4.4.1, Chart.js

##### Back End:
     JSON, PHP, MySQL DB
   
#### This app would be useful to people who have:
* An insurance claim and;
* A large list (100+) of non-restorable or lost or "written-off" items and;
* The insure policy entails paying the insured (you) an actual cash value, upfront, for lost items as well a recoverable amount that you can collect by providing a receipt for each item.

This would commonly include fire and flood insurance claims.

#### Key useful features:

  * Organizes items into groups by status, and lists items in tables,.
  * Tracking item status data: replacing items, submitting items, finalizing items, etc.
  * Displaying useful calculations such as:
    * Display amount needed to spend to collect maximum refund amount.
    * Side by side comparison of what you need to spend and what you will get back (money) in return from the insurance company/claim.
  * Displays important stats related to money collection progress and potential.
  * Sortable, searchable data
